<div style="height:200px;width:800px;border:1px solid #ccc;font:16px/26px Verdana;overflow:auto;text-align:left">  I am a first generation college student from Honduras currently majoring in Psychlogy. I will be graduating in Spring 2020 with my bachelor's in Psychology with a minor in Human development and family science at the University of Georgia. Growing up, my family placed unwavering importance on higher education in the way that they raised myself and my younger cousins. This is primarily because it was the very thing most of my family members were not able to attend. Back home in Honduras, it is evident that women are still viewed as the primary caregivers in the home and continue to face harsh barriers when entering the workforce and education fields that women in this country have fought relentlessly to dissolve for generations. I believe it is because of this reason that the women who raised me were not able to obtain the education they needed, not for lack of motivation but due to barriers that made it impossible for them to achieve an education. I am grateful today to be a first-generation Honduran student here in the U.S and be able to prove just how capable Latinx women can be in the academic field.</div>
